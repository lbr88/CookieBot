/**
 * Manages Stock Market (Bank minigame) trading logic
 *
 * The Stock Market allows buying and selling goods with fluctuating prices.
 * The bot tracks price movements and trades based on thresholds.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * - Buy brokers to increase stock limits
 * - Upgrade offices to unlock more goods
 * - Track min/max prices for each good
 * - Buy when price is rising and below threshold
 * - Sell when price is dropping and above threshold
 * - During night: aggressive buying at low prices, selling at high prices
 *
 * Original implementation: lines 1500-1591 in cookieAutoPlayBeta.js
